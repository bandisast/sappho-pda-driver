# S.AP.P.H.O. PDA Driver
### Scattering-based APparatus for Portable Haematological analysis via Optics

This repository is a fork of StratosGK's "SGK_PDA" driver for the AMS TSL1401CL PDA. This fork will serve as the driver for the Toshiba TCD1103GFG PDA, which is used in our thesis (Scattering measurements with the Beaglebone microcomputer for portable biomedical sensors). Our thesis is the immediate successor of StratosGK's thesis (Fabrication of a photodiode sensor system using the BeagleBone microcomputer for use in non-invasive biomedical sensors).

Target Platform: Beaglebone Black Rev. C

PDA: Toshiba TCD1103GFG PDA
